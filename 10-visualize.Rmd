There are many plotting packages for R, as well as the base plotting system; however, ggplot2 is one of the most efficient plotting packages to produce high quality figures in a relatively short amount of time.

## Lesson
1. [Creating publication-quality graphics with ggplot2](http://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder/08-plot-ggplot2/index.html)

## Tips
- Keep your data tidy (3 rules)
- Reshape your data (tall & thin often better for visualization & analysis)
- [Use factors (for reorder & better labeling)](https://blog.rstudio.com/2016/08/31/forcats-0-1-0/)
