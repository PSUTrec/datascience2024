## Creating reproducible work products
One of the many advantages of working in R and R Studio is the ability to create shareable and reproducible work products (e.g. interactive dashboards, static or interactive reports, interactive webpages, and websites such as this).

Throughout this course we've been using R Markdown, however there are many other options to create a work product depending on your specific needs. Below is a list of few resources that will point you to other commonly used packages to create a variety of work products based on your needs.
