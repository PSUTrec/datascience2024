# Syllabus

Tired of finding errors in your spreadsheets that perpetuate and cascade through your work? Still trying to cram “big” data into tiny worksheets? Wish you had an easier way to easily share data and results with others? Want to better manage and maintain your workflow? Always wanted to learn R and version control but never found the time? If any of your answers are yes, then this course is for you! Building on other successful data science training resources, this course exposes students in transportation research and practice and best practices in scientific computing through hands-on lab sessions.

## Location and Time
- Room: Portland State University Engineering Building, 315
- Time: September 10-12, 9:30am - 4:30pm

## Prerequisite

Basic knowledge and experience of conduct scientific research with quantitative information; skill of using (or keen to learn) a programming language and/or data processing and statistical software (such as python, R, SPSS, Stata).

## Format

Classes will all be hands-on sessions with lecture, discussions, and labs. Readings drawn from books, articles, and online resources will be assigned. Students are expected to read them before class and to participate in class discussions. Highlights of the class include creating a work product in which students go through the process of data retrieval, processing, conducting analysis, and developing a report/article while learning the best practices of data science.

## Software and Hardware

This course will use R, the free statistical software, and RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/) as our main interface to R. The lecture and lab instructions will be provided using R. Student must bring their own laptop. The instructor and TA will help the students set up their laptop to run all examples/exercises. They can review/re-run the examples in lectures and labs by themselves.
