# Syllabus

Tired of finding errors in your spreadsheets that perpetuate and cascade through your work? Still trying to cram “big” data into tiny worksheets? Wish you had an easier way to easily share data and results with others? Want to better manage and maintain your workflow? Always wanted to learn R and version control but never found the time? If any of your answers are yes, then this course is for you! Building on other successful data science training resources, this course exposes students in transportation research and practice and best practices in scientific computing through hands-on lab sessions.

## Location and Time
- Room: Portland State University Engineering Building, 315
- Time: September 10-12, 9:30am - 4:30pm


## Format

Classes will all be hands-on sessions with lecture, discussions, and labs. Readings drawn from books, articles, and online resources will be assigned. Students are expected to read them before class and to participate in class discussions. Highlights of the class include creating a work product in which students go through the process of data retrieval, processing, conducting analysis, and developing a report/article while learning the best practices of data science.

## Software and Hardware

Participants are responsible for bringing their own laptop with the required software installed. If you're using a government issued laptop, you might need to reach out to your IT department as some of these installations might required admin rights. The following is a list of required software:  

- [R](https://cran.rstudio.com/)
- [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [JKD 21](https://adoptium.net/) (Windows users: suggest "Install just for you" install option)

Please follow these directions
