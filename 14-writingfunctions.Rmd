## What is a function?
A function is a sequence of specific operations combined into a single repeatable action with specific inputs and outputs.

## When to create your own function?
- When you find yourself running a specific sequence of operations over and over again.
- When you're collaborating on a project where a specific calculation must be consistent and used by multiple people (and reduce the chances of making mistakes).
